# Ring Captcha

_Ring Captcha_ is a library for creating and checking ring captcha.

_Ring Captcha_ is a graphical type of captcha. A user must see an image and 
count rings drawn on the image. After the first guess attempt the captcha is 
destroyed to avoid getting an answer by brute force.

The library includes a manager which is able to serve created images via the 
_HTTP_ protocol.
